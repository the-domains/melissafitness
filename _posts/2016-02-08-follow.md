Thank you for visiting my page! If you like what you see, please click the "Like" button and come back for daily inspiration, clean eating ideas and health and fitness motivation. I am new Mom who fell back in love with health and fitness two years ago, after an 8 year struggle, where not only was I unhealthy, but I was lacking confidence and wasn't truly happy. If there was one thing I always knew, it was that I wanted to be a wife and a Mom. So I needed to take control of my life, my health, in order to a great role model for my children and spend many wonderful, healthy and happy years with my family. My journey was far from easy, and I don't believe it's ever over! I'm not perfect and I still struggle regularly...if not daily, but I can finally say I am truly happy and the healthiest I have ever been. And I honestly don't know if I would be where I am today if it wasn't for someone paying it forward. So it's my turn to pay it forward and I want to help YOU take control of your life, tackle the obstacles and truly go after your goals...whether it be related to health or fitness...or, if like me, you want to coach others and create a business that allows you to work from home and create a world of opportunities for you and your family. Even if you only take one thing away from my page...I am happy!! My goal is to add value to someone's life every day...and I hope that person is YOU!!! If you are looking for motivation, support and accountability on your health and fitness journey, I'd love for you to join my HEART Challenge. Let me know what your health and fitness goals are!
