Who has a hard time getting all their greens?? We definitely do...so are going to be trying this salad. Even with the dressing the salad doesn't get soggy so you can prep ahead!! And cost per serving is under $2! Who says eating clean is expensive? ------------------------------------------------

For those using the portion control containers, 1 serving is 1 1/2 green, 1 yellow and 1/2 blue/orange.
