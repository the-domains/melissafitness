I get a lot of questions about what I eat? How I've lost all the baby weight? What diet am I on?
----------------------------------------------
Answer: I don't diet! I eat well. I live a healthy lifestyle. Typically I follow a rule of 80:20 and that's what I help other people do too!
Do I feel guilty when I eat chocolate? Have a glass of wine? No way!! I enjoy themðŸ˜Š
---------------------------------------------
Today's breakfast...Meal \#2 is grilled asparagus (1 green), quinoa (1 yellow) and two hard boiled eggs (1 red).
