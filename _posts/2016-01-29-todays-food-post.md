In January 2014, I hosted my first fitness challenge. I was still new to the whole coaching idea and was scared to really talk to anyone about it so I found a whole bunch of people that already owned the program, Focus T25 and were looking for a coach.

I then hosted a group on Facebook where I gave daily tips, motivation and support and we would check in daily. It was awesome! And I needed it, because after finishing Focus T25 in December I was worried I would fall back into my old ways. And I'm not alone, so many people after their first program stop! And as a Coach, I am here to help make sure they don't want to. In fact, many of them are still in my challenge group today.

Many of my challengers ended 2014 on a high note. They accomplished amazing personal goals and had made healthy changes to their lifestyle. It has been such a blessing to watch them transform and to have played even a small part in their journey.
