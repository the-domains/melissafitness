There are several benefits of having a good diet, such as improved mood, helps fight disease, boosts energy and helps with weight loss.

They say weight loss is 30% fitness, 70% diet. When I say diet, I don't necessarily mean cutting back your food intake. And I definitely do not mean starving yourself. I simply mean the food that you eat.
