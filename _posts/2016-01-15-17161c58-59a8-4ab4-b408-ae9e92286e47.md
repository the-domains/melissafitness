My Story
Ever since I was little I was very active. I played competitive sports and loved being part of a team. When I graduated from University I got an office job. My fitness levels started to decline and my stress levels continued to elevate. ![Health & Fitness Coach, Mompreneur & Business Mentor - Posting daily health, fitness & nutrition tips - to help you be a healthier, happier & stronger YOU!](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/dbff604eeb8a30efe12e570da9a6155b9e31add3.jpg)

I was constantly tired, less happy and got sick frequently. All tests said I was a healthy individual, so doctors concluded the cause was STRESS! My doctor ordered me to do 30 minutes of physical activity a day - something that used to be a regular part of my life. 

Many times I tried to get back into a fitness routine and fell short every time - without a team, I was hopeless. I started playing recreational soccer, but I had a long way to go. Sadly I had another setback, I tore my ACL. 

I couldn't do much in terms of fitness for 6 months. I had reconstructive knee surgery and a year long recovery. I did 6 months of physiotherapy and managed to regain a lot of my strength but was still not 100%. 

My knee surgery hit me hard, I lost a lot of muscle tone and it made me feel weak. It made me realize I needed to take control of my own life. In order to do that I needed to eat better, exercise more and create a better me. I realized what I needed to do, but how was I going to motivate myself to finally do it. 

I needed a team, a support system. So I signed up and joined a great team - where we are all committed to health and fitness, both improving our own and that of others. Since joining a team and starting a challenge, I have worked out everyday, been less stressed and am feeling great. I am finally committed to a better me!
