# Insanity 

<article style=""><h1>Melissa Bourdages</h1><p>I'm 1/4 of the way through Insanity...and I am feeling great and LOVING IT!!! I was beyond scared to try Insanity, and held off for what felt like ages. But let me tell you, although tough, Shaun T is amazing and encourages you to take a break whenever your heart rate is too high, your form is compromised or if you just feel your body needs it.</p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r5pO9QmvcpM/U9KKuWoPjlI/AAAAAAAAAP4/D3Qos4q5Llg/s1600/photo+2.JPG" /></article>
