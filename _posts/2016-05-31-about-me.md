  Who am I? I am a new Mom, a wife, a business owner…a woman who has found her
  passion in life and is building a life she loves.


  But it wasn’t always like that. My story, my journey has many bumps, many
  successes and I know its far from over!


  For most of my life I was an athlete…a competitive soccer player and I thrived
  working with and leading a team. In University I made a decision to switch my
  focus away from my passion to what I felt was expected of me…education. 


  To sum it up quickly, I lost my identity and my ambition to workout and stay
  healthy. My health rapidly declined and I was always tired, constantly sick
  and didn’t feel like myself. After many failed attempts to restart…I needed a
  solution.


  In that time I graduated university, became a 9-5’er at a desk job that was
  not my passion. I enjoyed my work, I worked hard but eventually I felt like I
  wasn’t following my heart. That I was again, following the norm and leading a
  life that didn’t fill my cup.
