  Breakfast...steel cut oats for everyone. Super simple and healthy! I make one
  big batch, purée about 1/3 for Charlie and keep 2/3 for me. We then have
  prepped oatmeal for the week.



  I mix Charlie's with an equal amount of puréed steamed pears or apples. And
  mine I'm still having 1 tsp each of natural PB&J.



  Charlie has an awesome appetite!! #babyfood #babyfoodideas
