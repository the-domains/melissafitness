<h1>About Me</h1><p>Who am I? I am a new Mom, a wife, a business owner&mldr;a woman who has found her passion in life and is building a life she loves. But it wasn&rsquo;t always like that. My story, my journey has many bumps, many successes and I know its far from over! For most of my life I was an athlete&mldr;a competitive soccer player and I thrived working with and leading a team. In University I made a decision to switch my focus away from my passion to what I felt was expected of me&mldr;education. To sum it up quickly, I lost my identity and my ambition to workout and stay healthy. My health rapidly declined and I was always tired, constantly sick and didn&rsquo;t feel like myself. After many failed attempts to restart&mldr;I needed a solution. In that time I graduated university, became a 9-5&rsquo;er at a desk job that was not my passion. I enjoyed my work, I worked hard but eventually I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t following my heart. That I was again, following the norm and leading a life that didn&rsquo;t fill my cup. </p></article></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><a href="index.html" class="m-r-1 m-b-1 v-a-m d-ib" data-reactid="28"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c6198efb-5107-4bdc-8054-8d4a30c676e5.png" class="h-2rem w-a" data-reactid="29"/></a><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="30"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="31">About Me</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="34"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
