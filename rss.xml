            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Melissa Bourdages</h1><p>I also got to work out live with professional trainers and thousands of coaches. It was so cool! I was completely overtaken by emotion when I got to work out with Shaun T, doing Focus T25...the program that changed it all for me. To this day, it remains my favourite program...and he is my favourite trainer.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c61cdae68cb5826c5f18efa15cb50f6840ce1b65.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Decide, Commit and you will succeed</h1><p>In January 2014, I hosted my first fitness challenge. I was still new to the whole coaching idea and was scared to really talk to anyone about it so I found a whole bunch of people that already owned the program, Focus T25 and were looking for a coach.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/de58bab91cba1ab04d486bf02ad09f726f8ecf54.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Many people ask me how I got my results. And they say they want the same results too. Yet they aren't willing to invest in their health. I get it!! Spending money on a program, on a product that may/may not change your health is scary. I was there...I was worried...would it work for me? That's what stops most! Can someone get results without them?? Of course!!! But at the end of the day, the programs, the products they work! Don't trust me, trust the hundreds of thousands of lives changed! And the community and support is what made the difference for me. When it came time to make that decision I had to decide...can I afford not to invest in my health?? Answer...NO! I was tired of feeling like shit. If you are too, if you are serious about change, you want something that works and a community and coach that will support, motivate and kick your butt when needed...let me know üòò]]></title>
