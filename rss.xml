            <title><![CDATA[Breakfast...steel cut oats for everyone. ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Breakfast...steel cut oats for everyone. </h1><p>Breakfast...steel cut oats for everyone. Super simple and healthy! I make one big batch, purée about 1/3 for Charlie and keep 2/3 for me. We then have prepped oatmeal for the week.

I mix Charlie's with an equal amount of puréed steamed pears or apples. And mine I'm still having 1 tsp each of natural PB&J.

Charlie has an awesome appetite!! #babyfood #babyfoodideas</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bd30d50a-211b-4d57-bfd5-b0fecffcd776.jpg"></article>]]></description>

I was still new to the whole coaching idea and was scared to really talk to anyone about it so I found a whole bunch of people that already owned the program, Focus T25 and were looking for a coach.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/de58bab91cba1ab04d486bf02ad09f726f8ecf54.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Melissa Bourdages</h1><p>I also got to work out live with professional trainers and thousands of coaches. It was so cool! I was completely overtaken by emotion when I got to work out with Shaun T, doing Focus T25...the program that changed it all for me. To this day, it remains my favourite program...and he is my favourite trainer.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c61cdae68cb5826c5f18efa15cb50f6840ce1b65.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Ever since I was little I was very active. I played competitive sports and loved being part of a team. When I graduated from University I got an office job.
